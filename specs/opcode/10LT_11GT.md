# LT & GT opcode
## Procedure

The `LT` and `GT` opcode compares the top two values on the stack, and push the
result (0 or 1) back to the stack.

## Csontraints

1. opId = OpcodeId(0x10 | 0x11)
2. state transition:
    - gc + 3 (2 stack reads + 1 stack write)
    - stack_pointer + 1
    - pc + 1
    - gas + 3
3. lookups: 3 busmapping lookups
    - `a` is at the top of the stack
    - `b` is at the new top of the stack
    - `result` is at the new top of the stack


## Exceptions

1. stack underflow: the stack is empty or only contains one element
2. out of gas: the remaining gas is not enough
